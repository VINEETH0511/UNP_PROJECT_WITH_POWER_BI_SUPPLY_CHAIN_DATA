# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLYCHAIN_DATA

I did a project in the collabration with UNP. The Supply Chain Dashboard created using Power BI provides an overview of key metrics, including Total Revenue (577.60K), Total Cost (52.92K), and Total Profit (524.68K). It analyzes customer demographics, product types (cosmetics, haircare, skincare), defect rates, lead times, and revenue by supplier. The insights suggest the need to reduce defect rates in skincare products, optimize logistics costs, improve supplier lead times, and focus on high-performing SKUs and customer preferences. Although the business is highly profitable, strategic improvements in quality control, logistics, and supplier management could enhance overall efficiency and growth.
